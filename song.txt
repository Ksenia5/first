Too much in my system (famine, famine)
Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
Mama making ends meet (making ends meet)
Working like a slave (Mississippi, ay, ay)


Daddy ain't at home, no (father, father)
Gotta be a man (Michael Corleone)
Do it for my homegrowns (sisters, brothers)
Do it for the fam (yeah, so tell 'em, Labby)


Ay (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Just for your love, yeah, I'll (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Give you the world (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Mona Lisa's smile (oh, oh, oh, oh)


Hey (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Hell, I'll do twenty-five to life (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If it makes me your king (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A star in your eyes (oh, oh, oh, oh)
