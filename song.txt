Too much in my system (famine, famine)
Money MIA (pockets hella empty)
Mama making ends meet (making ends meet)
Working like a slave (Mississippi, ay, ay)
Daddy ain't at home, no (father, father)
Gotta be a man (Michael Corleone)
Do it for my homegrowns (sisters, brothers)
Do it for the fam (yeah, so tell 'em, Labby)
